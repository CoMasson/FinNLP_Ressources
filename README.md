## NLP Workshops on Economics & Finance 
### FNP : Financial Narrative Processing Workshop
**Description** : The workshop will focus on the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Corpus Linguistics (CL) methods related to all aspects of financial text mining and financial narrative processing (FNP). One focal point of the proposed workshop is to develop a better understanding of the determinants of financial disclosure quality and the factors that influence the quality of information disclosed to investors beyond the quantitative data reported in the financial statements. The workshop will also encourage efforts to build resources and tools to help advance the work on financial narrative processing (including content retrieval and classification) due to the dearth of publicly available datasets and the high cost and limited access of content providers. The workshop aims to advance research on the lexical properties and narrative aspects of corporate disclosures, including glossy (PDF) annual reports, US 10-K and 10-Q financial documents, corporate press releases (including earning announcements), conference calls, media articles, social media, etc.

### FINLP : Financial Technology and Natural Language Processing Workshop
**Description** : The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum where international participants can share knowledge on applying NLP to the Financial Technology (FinTech) domain. In order to bridge the gap between the NLP researches and the financial applications, we plan to organize, FinNLP, a workshop on FinTech and NLP. With the sharing of the researchers in FinNLP, the challenging problems of blending FinTech and NLP will be identified, and the future research direction will be shaped. That can broaden the scope of this interdisciplinary research area.

### FNP-FNS : Financial Narrative Processing and MultiLing Financial Summarisation Workshop
**Description** : This is the first joint workshop between FNP and MultiLing workshops, both workshops have been running for several years with great success.The joint workshop will focus on the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Corpus Linguistics (CL) methods related to all aspects of financial text mining and financial narrative processing (FNP) in addition to demonstrating the value and challenges of applying summarisation to multilingual financial text, usually referred to as financial narrative disclosures. There is a growing interest in the application of automatic and computer-aided approaches for extracting, summarising, and analysing both qualitative and quantitative financial data.
